# USCHomelessWebsite
In collaboration with USC's Initiative to Eliminate Homelessness, I created a website that conglomerates all the relevant resources for the student homeless population here at USC. Its data comes from USC, the city of Los Angeles, and the various national organizations with something to contribute. 
-Implemented in HTML/CSS/Javascript and Bootstrap Framework
-100+ Monthly Active Users
-Supported by the Dean of Social Work
-Garnering information of the affected population to start a dialogue between different departments in the University (i.e. Financial Aid Office, USC Senate, etc.)
